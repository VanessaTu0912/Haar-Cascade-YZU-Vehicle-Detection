# Haar-Cascade-YZU-Vehicle-Detection
Based on the Haar Cascade method, a campus vehicle detection model for Yuan Ze University was developed using OpenCVâ€™s createsamples and traincascade tools. The system aims to track vehicles within the campus to enhance environmental safety, and its performance is evaluated using a ROC curve.


Make sure you have the following installed:
Python 3.x
OpenCV (recommend version 3.4.11)
NumPy
Matplotlib (for ROC curve visualization)

You can install dependencies via pip:
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib

Installation & Setup:
1. Clone the Repository
   git clone https://github.com/VanessaTu0912/Haar-Cascade-YZU-Vehicle-Detection.git
   cd Haar-Cascade-YZU-Vehicle-Detection
2. Prepare Training Data
   Store all positive samples (images with vehicles) in a pos folder.
   Store all negative samples (background images) in a neg folder.
   Generate pos.txt (positive samples annotations) and neg.txt (negative samples file paths).
   (You can generate it by the code I uplode)
3. Create .vec File
   Use opencv_createsamples.exe:
   opencv_createsamples -info pos.txt -vec samples.vec -num 300 -w 100 -h 100
4. Train the Classifier
   Use opencv_traincascade.exe with parameters: (or change the path to where you download the
   file in train_classifier.bat and save it, then tape it to train the classifier)
   opencv_traincascade -data classifier_output -vec samples.vec -bg neg.txt -numPos 280 -numNeg
   144 -numStages 10 -w 100 -h 100 -featureType HAAR -minHitRate 0.985 -maxFalseAlarmRate 0.6 -
   maxWeakCount 50
5. Once training is complete, use the trained model (classifier_output/cascade.xml) in a
   detection script:
   python test.py
   you can yose the test_images with test_xml file to do the detection
6.Evaluation (ROC Curve)
  To evaluate model performance:
  python evaluate_haar_roc.py
  This will: Compare prediction results with ground truth, plot ROC curve ,and compute AUC score
